# Online_Course_Management_System

**Description** :
===

The Online Course Management System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the management and administration of courses in an educational institution. The system provides different user roles, including Admin, Teacher, and Student, each with specific functionalities and access levels.

The Admin role serves as the system's primary administrator, requiring login credentials for access. Admins are responsible for assigning courses to teachers and managing overall system settings.

The Teacher List View allows users with administrative privileges to view a comprehensive list of teachers associated with the system. This feature aids in the organization and tracking of teachers' information.

Similarly, the Student List View provides an overview of all registered students. This functionality assists in managing and monitoring student enrollment.

Teachers can access the system by logging in with their credentials. Upon login, they gain access to the Course List View, where they can view and manage the courses assigned to them. This includes updating course details, posting announcements, and interacting with enrolled students.

The Course Registration feature enables students to log in and register for available courses. Students can browse the course catalog, select desired courses, and complete the registration process through this module.

Once logged in, students have access to their Course List View, where they can view the courses they are enrolled in. This feature allows students to track their progress, access course materials, submit assignments, and interact with teachers and fellow students.

The tech stack for this project comprises Java as the programming language, Servlet for handling HTTP requests and responses, JSP (JavaServer Pages) for generating dynamic web content, MySQL as the database management system for storing application data, Maven for project management and dependency handling, JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) for simplifying JSP development, and Eclipse as the integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and testing the application code.

By utilizing these technologies, the Online Course Management System offers a comprehensive platform that streamlines the management of courses, facilitates effective communication between teachers and students, and enhances the overall learning experience within the educational institution.
